#DPDtesting

Playing with variable number of particles in beads in a DPD simulation.

## Exploration aims
The aim is to address the following problems:

1. Comparison of various parametrisations. 
Assuming same bead sizes and masses.
  1. GW: aii = 25kT for all beads, delta(a) from FH theory based on solubility
  2. Kacar, EPL, 2013: aii = different according to compressibility, delta(a)
     from FH theory based on solubility

2. Comparison of various different bead interactions
Assuming same bead sizes and masses.
  1. FH theory
  2. Travis, JCP, 2007: regular solution theory

3. Different bead sizes.

4. Different bead masses.


## Exploration systems
1. Water-methanol mixture.
2. Water-PE mixture.
3. Some third interesting system.


## Comparison
Compare DPD simulations with the following fine-grained systems.
1. Classical MD, using established force fields.
2. AIMD
3. Experiment, hopefully possible.


## Observables
1. Radial distribution function of key atoms.
2. FILL
